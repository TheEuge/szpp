# .htaccess temporarily disabled
#
# The repository previously enforced Apache Basic Auth for admin.php. That
# rule has been moved to `.htaccess.disabled` so that the container will not
# challenge with HTTP Basic Auth while we debug the PHP admin login flow.
#
# To restore Basic Auth, move the contents of `.htaccess.disabled` back into
# this file and update {SITE_ROOT} to the absolute path to the site on the
# server (for example /var/www/html/Simple/.htpasswd).
<Files "admin.php">
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Restricted Area"
  AuthUserFile "{SITE_ROOT}/.htpasswd"
  Require valid-user
</Files>

# Replace {SITE_ROOT} with the absolute path to this site's directory, e.g. /var/www/html/Simple/.htpasswd
